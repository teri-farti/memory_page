# Memory

This project is a small, atmospheric symbol-matching game, created in a single day using the Godot 3 engine. The focus is on simplicity, a relaxed pace, and a cozy visual atmosphere, rather than mechanical complexity.

---

# Overview

The game features a quiet, minimalist board with flipped cards. The player flips pairs, trying to find matching symbols, while the environment subtly shifts tone. Smooth transitions, soft sound effects, and a warm color palette create a meditative feel, transforming classic mechanics into a relaxing micro-journey.
